I know him since childhood.We always study and play together.we never faught for anything.He always comes to play with me. </p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;Hey Ray let&#39;s play something!&#34;. &#34;Ok but what will we play?&#34;I replied.&#34;can we play hide n seek?&#34;Ace said.</p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;That&#39;s a good idea! But who will count?&#34;I asked.He taught for few minutes....</p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;I got an idea! Let&#39;s play stone paper scissors and decide who will count&#34;He suddenly replied</p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;That&#39;s a good idea&#34;. We both started to say</p><p style="text-align: left;">                                <b>Stone paper scissors!!!!!</b></p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;I won because you put scissors and i put stone&#34;I shouted. Ace&#39;s face was like <i>Ray won again....</i></p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;ok then you can hide&#34;Ace said in a low voice. He started counting <i>1....2....3.</i></p><p style="text-align: left;">After making sure he is not cheating i started running to find a place to hide.</p><p style="text-align: left;">I was running and running and running.......</p><p style="text-align: left;">Then i suddenly got an idea that if i hide in the forest he cannot find me that easily.</p><p style="text-align: left;">So i ran into the forest near our village. I ran deeper and deeper into the forest to find some place to hide. The forest was green.Full of nature,Birds sitting on trees rabbits hopping,and there were many monkeys over the tree.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The monkeys was looking at me like <i>what is this kid doing in our territory....</i></p><p style="text-align: left;">I was enjoying the nature {totally forgot that I came here to hide}.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Suddenly I heard peaple murmuring sound. Usually no one in our village comes here.</p><p style="text-align: left;">So who would be there?. I walked to the place where the sound is coming from. What?</p><p style="text-align: left;">There are some Soldiers planning about something.</p><p style="text-align: left;">I knew that the soldiers sitting there was not from our village.&#34;I think we should  Atack leafWood Village tomorrow itself&#34; first Soldier said.</p><p style="text-align: left;">I was hidding behind a tree and listening. What! Atack on our village!. I ran back to the village to inform someone about it so that they can do something to save the villagers!</p><p style="text-align: left;">I ran towards the wisest man in our village.</p><p style="text-align: left;">When Ace saw me running he shouted and said.&#34;heyy where were you?!!!&#34;</p><p style="text-align: left;">I didn&#39;t had much time  even to reply  Ace.I ran without saying anything.</p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;Wat.....&#34;Ace asked with a &#34;(●__●)&#34; face.</p></section><section><h2 id='s1'>Chapter 2 The wise man and his bodyguard </h2><p style="text-align: left;">I heard that the wise man lives in the biggest house in our village and have a bodyguard.</p><p style="text-align: start;">He knows everything in our village. He was not the king of the village but he was treated just like a king......</p><p style="text-align: start;">                                              But.      Why.     ?</p><p style="text-align: start;">He was in-charge of the village protection anyways so I will meet him and say about the coming disaster. Maybe he can save the villagers and village.</p><p style="text-align: start;">   I ran and ran and ran and ran and ran (๑•﹏•)</p><p style="text-align: start;">Finally I found one house which is big and has a big garden infront of it just like a castle.</p><p style="text-align: start;">          Filled with NATURE.....</p><p style="text-align: start;">THE BIRDS, SQUIRREL&#39;S, butterfly flying on the beautiful yellow and red flowers.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Dragonflies murmuring around freely,The rythemic sound of flowing water,waving sounds of trees . How peacefull and beautiful ( ◜‿◝ ).</p><p style="text-align: start;">I was enjoying the nature(again forgot). After few minutes a guy camed and ask</p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;Hey kid what are you doing here?!&#34;in a hard voice. &#34;BHA...BHA..uhh is th is the wi_w wise mans ho_ho house?...&#34;I was shoked so i couldn&#39;t answer properly...</p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;Yes.So?!&#34; He replied in a more hard sound.

You can go ask him permission&#34;He replied. Then he allowed me to go inside. He has very big muscles and a very small brain ಠ_ಠ. I was allowed to go inside but the problem is WHERE SHOULD I GO TO MEET HIM!!</p><p style="text-align: start;">I walked Here and there and there to here. Suddenly that man came to me again and asked &#34;Did you got the permission?!&#34;. The thing is i didn&#39;t even met him....</p><p style="text-align: start;"> &#34;But where should I meet him to ask permission?&#34;.
