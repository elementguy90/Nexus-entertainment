Everyone shouted.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Everyone ran with rage of protecting our village. The swordsman ran with glowing red sword.</p><p style="text-align: left;">The soldiers of other village was too much compared to us so the swordsman ordered for defence. The wise mans eye was glowing red.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Villagers and everyone did their best by protecting the village,small kids and women&#39;s.</p><p style="text-align: left;">many villagers were beeing killed. I was also protected by them. Then I saw a flag that was written as {redwall village}</p><p style="text-align: left;">Everyone was shivering in fear after seeing that flag... Is there anything scary??</p><p style="text-align: left;">Even the wise man was shoked. Hmmm </p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;We all are gonna die!!!&#34; One villager shouted.

He ran with his sword towards us.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Ohh no now I should fight.. people with me got scared.</p><p style="text-align: left;">One kid started crying&#34;.·´¯`(&#62;▂&#60;)´¯`·. AaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAaAaaaa</p><p style="text-align: left;">&#34;Don&#39;t cry don&#39;t cry!!&#34; I said</p><p style="text-align: left;">The soldier was about to swing his sword.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Now I was also ready to atack but I was shivering.oo.oo.</p><p style="text-align: left;">You can do it you can!!!!!!! If I could not protect these people then wise man will be very dissapointed at me!!!!</p><p style="text-align: left;">He swinged his sword . Yiuuuu caaannnnnnnnnnnn</p><p style="text-align: left;">.</p><p style="text-align: left;">.</p><p style="text-align: left;">.</p><br/><br/><p style="text-align: start;">You know I clearly dont know how to fight but I was strong. I don&#39;t know to aim.So I swinged the sword in randome direction.</p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;Let&#39;s go!&#34; But suddenly my sword just slipped Frome my hands and the soldiers sword was going to slice me. Now I was sure that I&#39;m going to die by the dissapointment of the wise man. How sad I am going to die when the war is just going to start. I think Ace will be alright. I&#39;m sure our village will win . At my last words &#34;bye village&#34; </p><p style="text-align: start;">And done.</p></section><section><h2 id='s1'>The End</h2><p style="text-align: left;">And it was my end.........</p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;Not yett!! Yoshiro cut off the hand of the soldier in the speed of air.</p><p style="text-align: start;">How cool!! His expressions was like <i>Easy</i></p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;Now run!&#34;Yoshiro shouted at me. I escaped with the peaple with me.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Now I wonder where is Ace. He just ran . I hope he is still alive.</p><p style="text-align: start;">Ok I reached the wise mans home. We entered to his garden and  entered his house kaboom!! Waat iss thiss!! Full of swords and awards.</p><p style="text-align: start;">There are many pictured of him. Wait There was no time to waste!             I quickly started searching for his basement. His house was very big so it would be very hard to find it. O! There is it! I found the basement!</p><p style="text-align: start;">There was a door and on top of it written as basement. I slowly opened the door. First it was dark but suddenly every light of the basement turned on. There was stairs going down. We all quickly go down to the basement . Down and down and down and down........ </p><p style="text-align: start;">And finally we reached to the basement. It was very big and beautiful.</p><p style="text-align: start;">The sound of war didn&#39;t came hear. I said everyone not to go out in any surcumstance. And I suddenly noticed a photo of someone who look familiar to the wise man but it was not him. I didn&#39;t seen him anywhere near the wise man. hmmmm. Anyways I ran out of the wise mans house quickly to join the war. I was running and suddenly a soldier jumped towards me and tried to kill me. Now the problem is... I don&#39;t have my sword!!!!!! You remember that my sword slipped from my hand and I forgot to take it back. Hmm but I have another technique called run as speed as possible. Ruuuuuuuun!!!!!!!!!!! I ran towards our villagers so I can get help. Suddenly the soldier swinged his sword. &#34;hraaaaaaaaaa&#34; I shouted my hannndsss it made a big wound in my hand &#34;iiit iss veery paainfull!!&#34; I shouted with pain. Now I was going to lose hope but someone pulled me towards a house quickly. Ya it was him Ace. &#34;Ray are you ok!&#34;he asked. &#34;Thank you. You are a life saver!&#34; I replied with the pain of my hand. I covered my wound. &#34;Where is your sword?&#34;he asked.</p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;H it is a big story......&#34;I replied. The soldier came inside the house and was going to swing his sword but Ace pushed him away and we both ran. Now we were searching for my sword. &#34;As I remember It would be in the way towards the wise mans house..&#34; I said.</p><p style="text-align: start;">&#34;Ok then let&#39;s search there&#34; he replied. I was happy that Ace is still with me. We searched for a while... Aand there it is. I found my sword. I took it. &#34;Now let&#39;s goo!&#34; I shouted. We both joined the war together.</p></section><section><h2 id='s2'>Lets join the war</h2><p style="text-align: left;">Now we ran towards the enemy soldiers.</p><p style="text-align: left;">Still I wanted to know about the redwall village. &#34;Hey Ace  do you know anything about the redwall village?&#34;I asked while running. &#34;Ya.
